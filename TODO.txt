This list is what I want to do with the script. Not everything will be developed because this are just some ideas I have for the future.
Remember you can always ask me to add something or customize some things for money.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS I WANT TO COMPLETE BEFORE NEW VERSION 1.4.3
- Mail options
	- new media mail send to uploaders friends
	- uploaded video is approved
	- User gets friend request
	- User gets new message
- Make jwplayer skin match templates	
- Forgot email in brown template on Login page
- More server info in status
- Embedded code on play page on/off


THIS IS A LIST I HAVE ON MY MIND:
- Change the way settings get pulled from DB.
- Cache for static pages
- Auto tag video's
- Remove categories and replace with TAGS video's have. (note: most video's belong in multiple categories, so why not use tags where they are for.)
- Protect video link and download link.



IDEAS FOR LATER:
- Automatic mail users every week/month with toprated/mostviewed/top 5, bleh bleh bleh
- Upload video's and make them public or private
	- My Media after login needs to show public and private
	- Friends can see this video option
	- members can delete own video's private/public
- Language module
- Seo on/off
- Jquery the hell out of administrator page. 
- Rotating thumbnails
- Theme week






PLUGINS IDEAS:
- Mobile version
- Multi-server
- Contact form
- Forum
- blog/news section
- User rights, with payment engines
- Advertising rotator
- Mass embedder
- User/visitor Profile spy (collect all data about a user like to see what he likes)
	- ip
	- Time on site and when
	- Which video's
	- Which tags


NEVER WILL DO THIS:
- API with other websites.
